Windows Quick List
==================

A Gnome-Shell extension which adds an icon to the top panel showing a list of all windows grouped by workspace.

This extension is heavily based on code, icons and ideas from the following projects:

* [Windows Quick List Applet] in Cinnamon
* [Minimized Windows List] by Xoff
